# HackPVTA : The projects

Between Feb. 5 and 7, 2016, ninety students from the Five Colleges signed-up for our event! The goal was to work with [PVTA data](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4JwQ7883JIGdk1nWmRQeXJ3T00&usp=sharing#list)
and discover new insights about our favorite service. In this github repo, we are showcasing some of the 
projects that resulted from that work. 

## How to submit your work. 

**If you have a Github account**, then feel free to fork this repository, upload your work, and then submit a pull request.
You may also ask to be added to our Github organization via an e-mail at grid-officers@cns.umass.edu.

**If you don't have a Github account** or you have one but are not quite sure on how to carry-out the above instructions, you can always e-mail us your files (presentation, code, etc.) and we will take care of the rest.
